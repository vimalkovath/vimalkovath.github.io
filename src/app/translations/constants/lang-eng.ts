  'aboutText0': `The first techs I learned were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular,bootstrap ,foundation ,
                 node, Java, node, mysql,sailsjs, ionic, Mongodb, groovy and oracle . I slightly decided
                to focus more on frontend technologies and to lean towards sophisticated JS frameworks as well as CSS
                pre-processors like Sass. I usually rely on the official documentation of Angular and Node to stay
                up to date. When I need to learn a new technology, Udemy and youtube is my go to solution as a starting point.`,
  'aboutText1': `I try to keep informed about the latest UI reports and practices.
                My favorite fields are definitely Interaction and Interface Development. I use these skills to build
                user-centred and consistent interfaces.`,
  'aboutText2': `I believe having an tested and agreed Developemnt (as much as possible) before any implementation is key.
                Assumptions and guessings based on a proper interpretation of a client’s need can help in certain
                situations and if they are not overused. I also consider having the right tools for any task or project
                is an investment worth if we aim to deliver a product of quality and to avoid delays.`,


  /*** PROJECTS ***/
  // Descs
  '#projectDescHce': `Showcase WordPress website for an association of southern France hairdressers and estheticians.
                      I served as UI Developer, mockups and POC with ngular and node.

  '#projectDescPortfolioV1': `First portfolio realised during  the design may sound awkward
                              but at least I managed to make it through!`,
  '#projectDescPortfolioV2': `My second open souce project, Its under developement , i am building all the components for that 
                             its in angular 6 and angular material compo.`,
  '#projectDescPortfolio3': `This portfolio has been realised with Angular 6 and its inspired from a designer portfolio named kevin.`,
  '#projectDescDigitela': `Corporate website of my first company. I was working on it in parallel of the clients'
                            projects when I had spare time. It was based on php, angular and the design was pretty basic
                            without that much of content. My role has been to rebuild the information architecture.`,
  '#projectDescApags': `Website for an bank related to 500 years of celebration. It has been my first web project for an
                        external client. It was for my internship during my intenship year at Objectstream.
                         I had a lot of autonomy for the design,development and the communication with my employer and
                        the client has been great. Unfortunately the project is for 6 month duration 
                         and the website does not exist anymore.`,
  '#projectDescEukiyo': `E-Ukiyo is an artistic contents sharing platform I created as an individual student project during
                        my bachelor year in Webdesign. I first presented the designs to a jury, composed of my teachers.
                        Then I developed it with Wordpress. The platform offers many profiles of users and artists
                        can upload their works. The name refers to the japanese artworks called ukiyo-e and the aim
                        was to attract mostly designers specialised into japonist art.`,
  '#projectDescC2I': `C2I Réseaux is an educational contents sharing platform made for student project in group.
                      It was supposed to allow teachers involved into the C2I (Internet & Computing Certicate)
                      to share their contents (courses, videos conference, podcasts) between themselves and
                      with the students. I cumulated both the roles of project manager and front-end dev in this project.
                      It was built on Wordpress but has unfortunately been cancelled because of the merging of
                      the regions Burgundy and Franche-Comté and therefore of their respective universities.`,
  '#projectDescImakr': `Rebuilding iMakr's E-Commerce platform has been my very first project after I arrived in London.
                        This website is selling 3D printing industry related products and they wanted to revamp
                        the overall design to make it more accessible to newcomers in this industry. Also it was
                        necessary to make the navigation and checkout process easier for the professionals.
                        My role has been to create a new design and present my ideas via complete mockups for each pages
                        and components. Then turning them into prototypes by using local HTML/CSS/jQuery pages.
                        Once agreed I ended up starting to develop.`,
  '#projectDescMMF': `MyMiniFactory, a subsidiary of iMakr, aims to provide a 3D printed contents/models sharing platform
                      for 3D designers and passionates. This application was more complex than iMakr's one because
                      the site is supposed to offer lot more interactions with the different contents and user
                      profiles. My role has been similar to my contribution to iMakr. Creating new designs,
                      mocking-up/prototyping my ideas for each page and component before starting the development.`,
  '#projectDescDoxy': `Doxy.me is an innovative telemedecine solution of which the company is based

  '#projectDescDnG': `An iOS ERP app for a Central London Real Estate Agent. The app is built with the framework Ionic
                      in a way it communicates with their desktop ERP through a common API. It has been developed in a
                      way to handle different user profiles and rights. I had to intervene into the design process,
                      especially the latest phases and obviously in taking the responsibility of building the front-end
                      structure (templates, components, stylesheets) from scratch.`,
  '#projectDescLloyds': `An IoT app for iOS. It has been my first mobile app project built with the framework Ionic.
                         Its purpose is to offer the possibility to gather the data from many connected objects, display
                         and interact with them within one hub application. I have been involved in the design and
                         development process. I built all the frontend architecture from top to bottom.`,
  '#projectDescEis': `My role had to serve three purposes. First  creating and implementing a new design for their
                      portal dedicated to brokers and underwriters. Then fixing many issues related to the old front-end
                      implementation (misuse of bootstrap and Sass). Finally I had to keep on with the evolutions
                      required by the client.`,
  '#projectDescMsa': `My role on this project has mostly been to fix UI issues, refactoring some templates as well as
                      creating new ones.`,
  '#projectDescSurely': `Regarding an upcoming event in which my company was due to participate I had to to work
                        on its new website. Albeit the project was already running for three months before I started being
                        involved, it had become necessary to wrap it up it within a short scope. I ended up adding the
                        missing contents and styles for the pages. I also reorganised the way the info was displayed
                        (everything was hard coded, no usage of posts). Finally I installed the plugins for SEO and
                        migration. As well as created one for the Analytics.`,
  '#projectDescFulfill': `We embarked upon our Innovation journey with the aim to disrupt the current scenario in Travel, 
                          with a clear goal of easing the pain points of the Traveler. Rather than an expanding portfolio, we focused
                           on removing the confusion and cumbersome processes that the Traveler faces in travel planning.
